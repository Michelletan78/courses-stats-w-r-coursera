##  Question 1
<strong>Follow the directions, Type `go()` and hit Enter to get started!in the console to open the R Markdown file.</strong>

You can use the RStudio platform just like you would on your home computer. 

<strong>The markdown file contains the instuctions to answer the multiple choice question below.<strong>

Q1. How many variables are included in this data set? 

*** =instructions
- 2 
- 3 
- 4
- 82
- 1710
*** =hint
The `dim()` funciton shows the number of rows and columns in a data set.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(statsr)
```

*** =sct
```{r,eval=FALSE}
msg1 <- "Try again, rerun the `dim()` function on the `arbuthnot` data."
msg2 <- "Nope, what was the result of the `dim()` function."
msg3 <- "Keep trying! Rerun the `dim()` function on the `arbuthnot` data."
msg4 <- "Great work!"
msg5 <- "Not quite, rerun the `dim()` function on the `arbuthnot` data."

test_mc(4, feedback_msgs = c(msg1, msg2, msg3, msg4, msg5))
```

## Question 2
<strong>Follow the directions in the console to open the `R Markdown file`.</strong>

You can use the RStudio platform just like you would on your home computer. 

<strong>The markdown file contains the instuctions to answer the multiple choice question below.<strong>

Q2. What command would you use to extract just the counts of girls born? 

*** =instructions
- `arbuthnot$boys`

- `girls`
- `arbuthnot[girls]` 
- `$girls` 

*** =hint
The `$` operator allows you to call a specific column within a dataset.

*** =pre_exercise_code
```{r,eval=FALSE}

dim(arbuthnot)
```

*** =sct
```{r,eval=FALSE}
msg1 <- "Not quite."
msg2 <- Nice job!"
msg3 <- "Keep trying!"

Sort your dataset in descending order based on the `total` column. You can do this 
interactively in the data viewer by clicking on the arrows next to the variable 
names. Or to arrange the data in a descending order with the new function: `desc` (for 
descending order).
