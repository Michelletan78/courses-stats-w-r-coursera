9.  Make a scatterplot of `avg_speed` vs. `distance`. Which of the following is true 
about the relationship between average speed and distance. 
<ol>
<li> As distance increases the average speed of flights decreases. </li> 
<li> The relationship is linear. </li> 
<li> There is an overall postive association between distance and average speed.</li> 
<li> There are no outliers. </li> 
<li> The distribution of distances are uniform over 0 to 5000 miles. </li> 
</ol>

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!

```{r avg-speed-dist-scatter}
# type your code for Question 9 here, and Knit
