<li> There is initially an increase in boy-to-girl ratio, which peaks around 1960. After 1960 there is a decrease in the boy-to-girl ratio, but the number begins to increase in the mid 1970s. </li>
<li> There is initially a decrease in the boy-to-girl ratio, and then an increase between 1960 and 1970, followed by a decrease. </li>
<li> The boy-to-girl ratio has increased over time. </li>
<li> There is an initial decrease in the boy-to-girl ratio born but this number appears to level around 1960 and remain constant since then. </li>
