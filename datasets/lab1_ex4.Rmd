## Dataset 2: Present birth records

In the previous few pages, you recreated some of the displays and preliminary 
analysis of Arbuthnot's baptism data. Next you will do a similar analysis, 
but for present day birth records in the United States. Load up the 
present day data with the following command.

```{r load-present-data}
data(present)
```

The data are stored in a data frame called `present` which should now be loaded in 
your workspace.

See Quesiton 4.

```{r variables-in-present}
# type your code for Question 4 here and use the output from this line to answer Question 4

```

<div id="exercise">
**Exercise**: What years are included in this dataset? **Hint:** Use the `range` 
function and `present$year` as its argument.
</div>

```{r years-in-present-data}
# type your code for Exercise here, and Knit

```
