2. Make a histogram and calculate appropriate summary statistics for **arrival** 
delays of `sfo_feb_flights`. Which of the following is false? 
<ol>
<li> The distribution is unimodal. </li> 
<li> The distribution is right skewed. </li> 
<li> No flight is delayed more than 2 hours. </li>

<li> More than 50% of flights arrive on time or earlier than scheduled. </li>
</ol>

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r sfo-feb-flights-arrival-delays}
# type your code for Question 2 here, and Knit

```
