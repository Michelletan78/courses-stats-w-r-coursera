<strong>Answer Question 2 to the left.</strong>

```{r load-packages, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
# Although the packages ggplot2, dplyr, and statsr are loaded, to Knit, you must have the library functions in your .Rmd file. Don't erase this code block!

library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r sfo-feb-flights-arrival-delays}
# type your code for Question 2 here, and Knit
