5. Calculate the total number of births for each year and store these values in a new 
variable called `total` in the `present` dataset. Then, calculate the proportion of 
boys born each year and store these values in a new variable called `prop_boys` in 
the same dataset. Plot these values over time and based on the plot determine if the 
following statement is true or false: The proportion of boys born in the US has 
decreased over time. 
<ol>
<li> True </li>
<li> False </li>
</ol>
