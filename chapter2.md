## Question 6
<strong>Follow the directions in the console to open the R Markdown file.</strong>

<strong>Q6. Is the mean and the median a more reliable measure for deciding which month(s) to avoid flying if you really dislike delayed flights, and why?</strong> 

*** =instructions
- Mean would be more reliable as it gives us the true average.
- Mean would be more reliable as the distribution of delays is symmetric.
- Median would be more reliable as the distribution of delays is skewed.
- Median would be more reliable as the distribution of delays is symmetric.
- Both give us useful information.
